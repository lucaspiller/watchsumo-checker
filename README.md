This is a core part of <a href="https://www.watchsumo.com/">WatchSumo, a website uptime
and performance monitoring service</a>. This code is responsible for checking
the uptime and SSL certificates of websites. Since it was first built, over 10
billion checks have been performed, so this code is pretty well battled tested.
